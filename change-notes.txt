3.62.267:

most of the additions fixes have been on comi definitions. so there should be a lot more and a lot more working.
the server now sorts the comics in the order of the last updated strip.
you can now read a comic while you are downloading it


3.61.265:

there has been much progress since the last release (around the end of last year)
since im not using file releases often and they are snapshots of the current repository, you should realy consider to just get the head at http://comcol.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=comcol/comcol;a=summary or directly via git!

there are a lot of stability and cleanup fixes. your database will stay more consistent and there are tools to check and repair the database.
it has also become even easyer to add new comics! over half of them just work with two lines, a name and the start url. it cant get easier than that! (can it?)
if comics dont work right away you can mostly get them to work by copy&paste of the source and some minimal knowledge of regexes and dont hesitate to drop us if note if you want a new comic added, we are always happy to see new comics!
i have also removed any threading because its unstable and its not nice to download that fast from one server anyway. instead you can now launch the programm multiple times with the --multi command line to speed up downloads! (keep the numbers sane though it seems a bit unstable with 20+ instances running!)

there are a lot more changes and features but they are mostly undocumented and unmentioned. so if you want to do something just ask, nothing is impossible!

and a final notice: the sourceforge tracker https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=209584 is currently the main way of communications. i know it seems a bit scary and empty but you cant do anything wrong if you use it! getting feedback is very important, so im glad for everything you have to offer :)
